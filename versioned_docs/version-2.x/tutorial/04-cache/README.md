Response cache is a technology that caches the data returned by server to the client. It avoids sending repeated requests when the server data can be reused. It can not only respond to user requests immdediately, but also save server resources. According to different caching scenarios, alova provides 3 modes named **memory mode, cache placeholder mode, and restore mode**. Just choose the one that suits you.

In addition, using the cache operation API, you can freely add, modify, and delete caches, as well as customize cache matching rules.
