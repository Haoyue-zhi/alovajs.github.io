## what is alova

A lightweight request strategy library, which provides targeted request strategies for different request scenarios to improve application availability and fluency, reduce server pressure, and enable applications to have excellent strategic thinking like a wise man. The alova core module provides various adapter interfaces and middleware mechanisms to ensure high scalability, so as to realize more request scenarios. If you have a request scenario that we are looking forward to but we have not realized it, you are also welcome to contribute your irreplaceable power to alova.

## Why create alova

Data requests have always been an essential part of applications. Since the birth of XMLHttpRequest, request schemes have emerged in an endless stream. The client's data interaction exploration has always focused on the following two directions:

1. Request implementation is getting simpler and simpler, such as `$.ajax`, `axios`, `react-query`, and `fetch api` and other request tools, the encoding form is constantly transitioning from callback function, Promise, and then to usehook, encoding The difficulty is getting smaller and smaller.
2. Data interaction prompts are becoming more and more friendly, and have roughly gone through the following stages:
   1. No state (stuck state)
   2. Loading waiting state, progress bar display
   3. Skeleton screen display, old data placeholder display

There are enough explorations in these two aspects, but in the era of more and more emphasis on user experience, we should pay more attention to the fluency of applications. People always blame the network state for the performance of data interaction, but we see frequent repeated requests everywhere.
Alova starts with the request strategy and is committed to solving the problem of application fluency. A good request strategy can not only improve performance and user experience, but also reduce the pressure on the server. **alova's mission is to make applications manage CS data interaction more intelligently**, and provide better request strategies for different request scenarios.
On the basis of the above, we abstract the request scenario and propose [Request Scenario Model (RSM)](/get-started/RSM), which explains alova's request strategy scheme well.

Alova has a very flexible expansion capability to implement request strategies in different scenarios. Our expectation for alova is a request strategy tool that can implement efficient requests for specific scenarios with simple coding. At the same time, in the scenario of non-sensing data interaction, alova has taken a big step forward. It allows users to respond immediately after submission without waiting for data requests to a certain extent. In the future, alova will continue to carry forward our exploration of request strategies.

> Currently supports **vue**, **react**, **react-native**, **svelte**, and also supports **Uniapp**, **Taro**, more framework support please look forward...

## Reasons for choosing alova

Alova is also committed to solving the problem of client network requests, but unlike other request libraries, alova chooses the direction of scenario-based request strategies. A good request strategy allows you to write less code to improve the application in the Fluency in requests. Alova provides many out-of-the-box scenario-based request strategies. At the same time, alova also provides a wealth of features to meet 99% of request requirements.

If you want to get a smooth application without writing more extra code, you might as well give it a try!

More complete feature is below:

1. üï∂ Provide a unified experience in the vue, react, and svelte, and seamlessly transplant
2. üìë The api design is similar to axios, more simple and familiar
3. üçµ Out-of-the-box high-performance request strategy, making the application smoother
4. üê¶ 4kb+, only 30% of axios+
5. üî© High flexibility, compatible with any request library, such as axios, superagent or fetch-api
6. üîã 3 data cache modes to improve request performance and reduce server pressure
7. üîå Rich extension functions, you can customize request adapter, storage adapter, middleware, and states hook
8. üñ•Ô∏è [2.2.0+]Server-side rendering(SSR)
9. üíï Request sharing to avoid sending the same request at the same time
10. ü™ë Data pre-fetching, which means users can see information faster without waiting
11. ü¶æ Real-time automatic status management
12. üé™ Interactive documentation and examples
13. üéàTypescript support
14. ‚ö° Support tree shaking, which means that the production volume of alova is often less than 4kb

## alova request strategy list

Alova is the core library, which provides common functions such as caching strategy, request sharing strategy, and state management, and can meet more than 95% of request requirements. At the same time, alova also provides business logic and frequently used request strategy hooks, which can be directly used in specific scenarios. The following is a list of request policy hooks provided by alova.

### More request-related business scenarios are being collected...

If you still have a specific and typical business request scenario, but we have not implemented it yet, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/alovajs/scene/issues/new/choose) to tell us here, we Will make it available to more people. You can also customize the request hook, please see the [Advanced](/category/advanced) section.

## Library Stability

It has been about a year since the development of the first version of alova. During this year, we have continued to find problems and optimize them. So far, alova has passed 143 unit tests, with a coverage rate of 99%. Even so, alova is still a rookie, so I suggest you use it sparingly.

If you find any problems with alova, you can tell us by [submit an issue](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/issues/new/choose), **WE PROMISE that after receiving the issue, it will be resolved as soon as possible. **

## Alternative to the request libraries?

alova is a request strategy library, which was originally created to provide specific request strategy solutions for different request scenarios, so as to achieve a smooth request experience more concisely and elegantly, such as `$.ajax`, `axios` and `fetch- api`, etc. provide good support for request sending and response receiving, they are an essential part of the [RSM](/get-started/RSM) process (request events), alova still needs to rely on them to make requests, so we can Think of alova as an arm of the request library, making the request library more powerful.

## Why binding UI framework?

Decoupling a js library means using it in more scenarios. For example, axios can be used in nodejs, but it also means that developers need to write more template code, such as using useHooks to encapsulate axios. However, alova abandons more usage scenarios brought about by decoupling, and positions the scope of use in conjunction with the UI framework to use alova in the most streamlined way. This is for the benefit of developers and is prevalent in a UI framework. Sometimes, deep binding can provide developers with direct-use functions and improve the developer's experience without requiring too much template code.
