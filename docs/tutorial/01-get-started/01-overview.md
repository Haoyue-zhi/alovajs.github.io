## What is alova

alova is a lightweight request strategy library that supports developers to implement complex requests such as request sharing, paging requests, form submissions, breakpoint uploads and others with declarative style code, allowing developers to implement high availability and high fluency request with less code, which means that you no longer need to rack your brains to write request optimization code, and no longer need to maintain request data and related status by yourself. You only need to select and use the request module, and set After setting the parameters, alova will do it for you. This improves development efficiency, application operation efficiency, and reduces server pressure.

## Why create alova?

Data requests have always been an essential part of applications. Since the birth of XMLHttpRequest, request schemes have emerged in an endless stream. Client data interaction exploration has always focused on the simplicity of requests, such as `$.ajax`, `axios`, `fetch api` and `react-query` and other request tools, the coding form is continuously developed from callback function, Promise, and then usehook. These js libraries have done a good job in request simplicity, but they only provide general functions, which means For different request scenarios such as sharing requests, paging requests, form submissions, uploading and downloading files, etc., developers still need to write complex codes themselves, which reduces development efficiency and performance cannot be guaranteed. In this era, application fluency has become more and more important.

**We believe that there are simpler solutions, such as using a use hook to get and manage paging data, manage form data, and implement brokenpoint continuingly-transferring, etc. That is use different request strategies in different request scenarios to efficiently implement the request function, so that developers can code less and achieve more efficient Client-Server data interaction. This is the solution we proposed and the mission of alova.**

You can use different request strategies to manage request timing and response data according to different request business scenarios, thereby improving performance and user experience, and reducing server pressure, so that both developers and users can benefit. On the basis of the above, we abstract the request scenario and propose [Request Scenario Model (RSM)](/tutorial/get-started/RSM), which explains alova's request strategy scheme well.

alova has very flexible expansion capabilities to implement request strategies in different scenarios, and users can also customize their own request scenarios.

In the future, alova will continue to carry forward our exploration of request strategies.

> Currently supports `vue/react/react-native/svelte`, and `next/nuxt/sveltekit` and other SSR frameworks, and also supports `Uniapp/Taro` multi-terminal unified framework, more framework support, so stay tuned...

In the scenario of non-inductive data interaction, alova has taken a big step forward. It allows users to respond without waiting for data requests to a certain extent. **In the next chapter, we will explain the non-inductive data interaction in a chapter related information**.

## Reasons for choosing alova

Alova is also committed to solving the problem of client network requests, but unlike other request libraries, alova chooses the direction of business scenario request strategy, and it also provides rich Advanced Features.

- You may have been thinking about how to wrap `fetch` and `axios`. Now you no longer need to do this. alova complete complex requests with declarative style, such as request sharing, paging requests, form submissions, breakpoint uploads, etc, as well as automated cache management, request sharing, cross-component status update, etc.
- alova is lightweight, only 4kb+, which is 30%+ of axios.
- alova is low-coupling, you can make alova work with any UI framework in any js environment through different adapters (built-in supported UI framework is `vue/react/svelte`), and provides a unified experience and perfect code migration.
- alova can also achieve a highly aggregated organization of APIs. The request parameters, cache behavior, and response data transform of each API will be in the same code block, which has great advantages for managing a large number of APIs.

:::info More framework support

Now, alova is available in [vue options (vue2 and vue3)](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#api-styles), [click here to view details](/tutorial/framework/vue-options). In the future, the following frameworks will be supported:

- Function style such as `solid/preact/qwik`.
- class style such as `angular/lit/stencil`.
- options style such as `native mini Program (Chinaüá®üá≥)`.

## alova request strategy list

Alova is the core library, which provides common functions such as caching strategy, request sharing strategy, and state management, and can meet more than 99% of request requirements. At the same time, alova also provides business logic and frequently used request strategy hooks, which can be directly used in specific scenarios. The following is a list of request policy hooks provided by alova.

## Alternative to the request libraries?

alova is a request strategy library, which was originally created to provide specific request strategy solutions for different request scenarios, so as to achieve a smooth request experience more concisely and elegantly, such as `$.ajax`, `axios` and `fetch- api`, etc. provide good support for request sending and response receiving, they are an essential part of the [RSM](/tutorial/get-started/RSM) process (request events), alova still needs to dependent on them to make requests, so we can Think of alova as an weaponry of the request library, making the request library more powerful.

## Why binding UI framework?

Decoupling a js library means using it in more scenarios. For example, axios can be used in nodejs, but it also means that developers need to write more template code, such as using useHooks to encapsulate axios. However, alova abandons more usage scenarios brought about by decoupling, and positions the scope of use in conjunction with the UI framework to use alova in the most streamlined way. This is for the benefit of developers and is prevalent in a UI framework. Sometimes, deep binding can provide developers with direct-use functions and improve the developer's experience without requiring too much template code.
