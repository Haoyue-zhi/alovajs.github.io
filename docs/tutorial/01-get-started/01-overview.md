## What is alova

alova is a lightweight request strategy library that use and manage APIs easily. It is mainly divided into the following two parts:

**Complete complex requests declaratively**

It supports developers to use declarative way for various complex requests such as request sharing, paging requests, form submission, breakpoint resumption, etc., allowing developers to use little code to complete high availability and high fluency network interaction. This means that you no longer need to write the codes about request logic, and no longer need to maintain relevant data and states yourself. You only need to select and use the request useHook, alova will take over it for you. This will improve development efficiency, application operation efficiency, and reduces server pressure.

**API automatic management and maintenance (developing)**

It can automatically generate complete and fully described request functions with full typescript type. You no longer need to consult the API documentation. Instead, you can find the request functions you need through keywords in the IDE, and then use them like accessing `location.reload` , allowing seamless connection between client side and server side. Whether it is a js project or a ts project, you can enjoy type hints for response data.

When the server updates the API, the front-end project will also receive a change notification and the project will be blocked from publishing.

## Breaking boundary of the usage of useHook

NOW, alova has perfect compatibility with [vue options, let's enjoy it!](/tutorial/framework/vue-options)

## Why was alova created?

Data requests have always been an indispensable and important part of applications. Since the birth of XMLHttpRequest, request schemes have emerged in endlessly. Client-side data interaction exploration has always focused on the simplicity of requests, such as `$.ajax`, `axios`, `fetch api` and Request tools such as `react-query`, the coding form continues to evolve from callback functions, Promise, to usehook. These js libraries have done a good job in making requests simple, but they only provide common functions, which means For different request scenarios such as sharing requests, paging requests, form submissions, uploading and downloading files, etc., developers still need to write complex codes themselves, which reduces development efficiency and performance cannot be guaranteed. As user experience becomes more and more important, In this era, application fluency has become more and more important.

Additionally, the collaboration between client and server is also separated. Front-end engineers need to consult API documents and manually write API functions, and any changes of APIs need to actively notify front-end engineers, which will make your product more uncontrollable.

**And we think there is a simpler solution that can complete complex requests in 2 steps:**

1. Use keywords directly in the IDE to find the specified request functions (all the request functions is automatically generated);
2. Based on your request scenarios such as paging, form submission, breakpoint resumption, etc., select the corresponding useHook, which will help you manage data and control when requests should be sent;

This allows developers to achieve more efficient Client-Server data interaction while writing little code. This is the solution we propose. Additionally, alova has very flexible expansion capabilities to implement request strategies in different scenarios. You can also customize your own request scenarios. This part is in [Advanced Chapter](/category/advanced).

In order to cover more request scenarios, we also abstracted the request scenarios into [Request scene model(RSM)](/tutorial/get-started/RSM), which explains alova's request strategy scheme well. In the future, alova will continue to carry forward our exploration of request strategies.

:::info API automatic management and maintenance (developing)

In order to seamlessly connect the client and server, we will automatically manage and maintain request functions through plugins, which are currently in development.

## Reasons for choosing alova

Alova is also committed to solving the problem of client network requests, but unlike other request libraries, alova chooses the direction of business scenario request strategy, and it also provides rich Advanced Features.

- You may have been thinking about how to wrap `fetch` and `axios`. Now you no longer need to do this. alova complete complex requests with declarative style, such as request sharing, paging requests, form submissions, breakpoint uploads, etc, as well as automated cache management, request sharing, cross-component status update, etc.
- alova is lightweight, only 4kb+, which is 30%+ of axios.
- alova is low-coupling, you can make alova work with any UI framework in any js environment through different adapters (built-in supported UI framework is `vue/react/svelte`), and provides a unified experience and perfect code migration.
- alova can also achieve a highly aggregated organization of APIs. The request parameters, cache behavior, and response data transform of each API will be in the same code block, which has great advantages for managing a large number of APIs.

:::info More framework support

Now, alova is available in [vue options (vue2 and vue3)](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#api-styles), [click here to view details](/tutorial/framework/vue-options). In the future, the following frameworks will be supported:

- Function style such as `solid/preact/qwik`.
- class style such as `angular/lit/stencil`.
- options style such as `native mini Program (Chinaüá®üá≥)`.

## alova request strategy list

Alova is the core library, which provides common functions such as caching strategy, request sharing strategy, and state management, and can meet more than 99% of request requirements. At the same time, alova also provides business logic and frequently used request strategy hooks, which can be directly used in specific scenarios. The following is a list of request policy hooks provided by alova.

## Alternative to the request libraries?

alova is a request strategy library, which was originally created to provide specific request strategy solutions for different request scenarios, so as to achieve a smooth request experience more concisely and elegantly, such as `$.ajax`, `axios` and `fetch- api`, etc. provide good support for request sending and response receiving, they are an essential part of the [RSM](/tutorial/get-started/RSM) process (request events), alova still needs to dependent on them to make requests, so we can Think of alova as an weaponry of the request library, making the request library more powerful.

## Why binding UI framework?

Decoupling a js library means using it in more scenarios. For example, axios can be used in nodejs, but it also means that developers need to write more template code, such as using useHooks to encapsulate axios. However, alova abandons more usage scenarios brought about by decoupling, and positions the scope of use in conjunction with the UI framework to use alova in the most streamlined way. This is for the benefit of developers and is prevalent in a UI framework. Sometimes, deep binding can provide developers with direct-use functions and improve the developer's experience without requiring too much template code.
