## What is alova

A lightweight request strategy library, which provides targeted request strategies for different request scenarios to improve application availability and fluency, reduce server pressure, and enable applications to have excellent strategic thinking like a wise man. The alova core module provides various adapter interfaces and middleware mechanisms to ensure high scalability and realize more request scenarios. If you have an expected request scenario but we have not implemented it, you are also welcome to contribute your irreplaceable power to alova.

## Why create alova

Data requests have always been an essential part of applications. Since the birth of XMLHttpRequest, request schemes have emerged in an endless stream. Client data interaction exploration has always focused on the simplicity of requests, such as `$.ajax`, `axios`, `fetch api` and `react-query` and other request tools, the encoding form is constantly transitioning from callback function, Promise, and then to usehook, which makes the request easier and simpler. However, in the era of more and more emphasis on user experience, our focus From the simplicity of the request to the fluency of the application, developers need to write more complex request logic according to different business scenarios, which is a test of the developer's skill level.

Alova focuses on improving application fluency, and uses different request strategies to manage request timing and response data according to different request business scenarios, thereby improving performance and user experience, and reducing server pressure. **alova's mission is to enable developers to achieve more efficient Client-Server data interaction while writing a small amount of code**, so that both developers and users can benefit
.

On the basis of the above, we abstract the request scenario and propose [Request Scene Model(RSM)](./RSM), which explains alova's request strategy scheme well.

Alova has a very flexible expansion capability to implement request strategies in different scenarios. Our expectation for alova is **a request strategy tool that writes less code to achieve efficient data interaction in specific business scenarios**.

In the future, alova will continue to carry forward our exploration of request strategies.

> Currently supports `vue/react/react-native/svelte`, and `next/nuxt/sveltekit` and other SSR frameworks, and also supports `Uniapp/Taro` multi-terminal unified framework, more framework support, so stay tuned...

At the same time, in the scenario of non-sensing data interaction, alova has taken a big step forward. It allows users to respond without waiting for data requests to a certain extent. **In the next chapter, we will explain non-sensing data Interaction related content**.

## Reasons for choosing alova

Alova is also committed to solving the problem of client network requests, but unlike other request libraries, alova chooses the direction of business scenario request strategy, and it also provides rich Advanced Features.

- You may have been thinking about encapsulating `fetch` and `axios`, but now you don‚Äôt need to do this anymore, alova has prepared all the advanced request functions you need, such as request use hooks, automatic cache management , request sharing, cross-component update status, and request strategies in different business scenarios are available out of the box.
- alova is lightweight, only 4kb+, which is 30%+ of axios.
- alova is low-coupling, you can make alova work with any UI framework in any js environment through different adapters (the built-in supported UI framework is `vue/react/svelte`), and provides a unified experience And seamless code porting.
- The use of alova can also achieve a highly aggregated organization of API codes. The request parameters, cache behavior, and response data conversion of each API will be gathered in the same code block, which has great advantages for managing a large number of APIs.

## alova request strategy list

Alova is the core library, which provides common functions such as caching strategy, request sharing strategy, and state management, and can meet more than 99% of request requirements. At the same time, alova also provides business logic and frequently used request strategy hooks, which can be directly used in specific scenarios. The following is a list of request policy hooks provided by alova.

## Alternative to the request libraries?

alova is a request strategy library, which was originally created to provide specific request strategy solutions for different request scenarios, so as to achieve a smooth request experience more concisely and elegantly, such as `$.ajax`, `axios` and `fetch- api`, etc. provide good support for request sending and response receiving, they are an essential part of the [RSM](./RSM) process (request events), alova still needs to rely on them to make requests, so we can Think of alova as an arm of the request library, making the request library more powerful.

## Why binding UI framework?

Decoupling a js library means using it in more scenarios. For example, axios can be used in nodejs, but it also means that developers need to write more template code, such as using useHooks to encapsulate axios. However, alova abandons more usage scenarios brought about by decoupling, and positions the scope of use in conjunction with the UI framework to use alova in the most streamlined way. This is for the benefit of developers and is prevalent in a UI framework. Sometimes, deep binding can provide developers with direct-use functions and improve the developer's experience without requiring too much template code.
