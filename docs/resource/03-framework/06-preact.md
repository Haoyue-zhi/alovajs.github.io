## Preact project with react coding style

Preact is highly compatible with react. If your project uses react coding style to write preact project, you can also use `alova/react` and then compile react code into preact code through compilation tools. The following is the configuration guide provided by preact:

- Preact's [official configuration tutorial](https://preactjs.com/guide/getting-started/#aliasing-react-to-preact).

- In vite, the official also provides **All in one** [vite plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@preact/preset-vite)

## Use preact package directly
